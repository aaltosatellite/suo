This is a modem library which aims to be reasonably portable, modular
and configurable in order to make to make modem implementations reusable
for different applications.

Another goal is to have good demodulation performance for weak signals
to make it usable for applications such as satellite communication.

The library defines interfaces based on function calls and callbacks
to separate the less platform-dependent DSP code from the more platform
depedent parts which interface to SDR hardware and protocol stacks.
Function calls between parts happen through function pointers placed in
structs, so that parts of the code can be changed.

For development purposes, there is a simple receiver implementation
for FSK packet signals. It's based on FM demodulation, so it does not
have the best weak-signal performance, but it helps test the interfaces
between things before a better receiver works.

There is also a better, modular receiver implementation which tries
to separate preamble detection (or more generally initial acquisition),
demodulation (including tracking of symbol sync, etc)
and deframing from each other.
It is still undergoing some refactoring and does not currently compile.
